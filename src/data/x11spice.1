.TH X11SPICE "1" "July 2016" "x11spice" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
x11spice \- Share an Xorg server via Spice
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B x11spice
[\fIOPTION\fR]
[\fI<listen-spec>\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
x11spice will allow a user to share an X11 session using libspice-server.
.PP
This provides a remote desktop access feature, using the Spice protocol.
.PP
If supplied, the first and only command line parameter will provide a
specification for how the Spice server should listen for connections.
.TP
The <listen-spec> is of the form:
  [[host]:[port][-end-port]
.PP
where host specifies the address to listen on (default: localhost),
and port specifies the port to listen to (default: 5900).
end-port, if given, will cause x11spice to scan from port to end-port
checking for an open port, and using the first one available.
.PP
By default, x11spice will display a simple dialog box which will show
connection status and provide a mechanism to disconnect a remote viewer
or exit the program altogether.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-config\fR[=\fIFILENAME\fR]
This will read configuration settings from FILENAME, ignoring all settings
in normal XDG locations.  If not provided, x11spice will first read settings
from /etc/xdg/x11spice/x11spice.conf, then overwrite them with any settings read
from ~/.config/x11spice/x11spice.conf.
.TP
\fB\-\-display\fR=\fIDISPLAY\fR
DISPLAY will use an alternate Xorg server.  The string should be in the standard
format used by X for the DISPLAY environment variable; e.g. :1.
.TP
\fB\-\-generate-password\fR[=\fILEN\fR]
When this option is selected, x11spice will generate a password randomly
and use that for the connection; the password will be printed to the standard
output for use.  If the optional LEN is given, the password will have that length.
.TP
\fB\-\-hide\fR
This will prevent the x11spice user interface from appearing at all.
.TP
\fB\-\-minimize\fR
If given, the x11spice user interface will start minimized.
.TP
\fB\-\-virtio-path=\fISOCKET-FILE\f
Path to a virtual io unix domain socket.  Should match the
-s option passed to spice-vdagent.
.TP
\fB\-\-uinput-path=\fIFIFO-FILE\f
Path to a unix fifo.  Should match the -u option passed to spice-vdagentd.
.TP
\fB\-\-password\fR=\fIPASSWORD\fR
If given, x11spice will directly use PASSWORD as an option.  \fBNote: this is not recommended.\fR
This will expose the password in the process list, which is a security concern.
.TP
\fB\-\-password-file\fR={\fI-\fR|\fIPASSWORD\fR}
If specified, x11spice will read the password from the given file, or stdin in the
case of a file named \fI-\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-ssl\fR[=\fIspec\fR]
This will turn on SSL mode.  At a minimum, SSL mode requires a server cert, private key,
and a CA certificate.  You can also optionally provide a key password, a dh_key_file,
and a ciphersuite.

The optional 'spec', if given, is a comma delimited list of file names.  The first file
name will be the CA cert .pem file, the second one the server cert file, the third the
private key.  The optional fourth parameter is the key password, then the dh_key_file,
and finally the ciphersuite.  You can skip one of the options by providing a blank entry
(e.g. --ssl=ca-cert.pem,,private-key.pem).
.TP
\fB\-\-timeout\fR[=\fISECONDS\fR]
If a timeout is specificed, if no connection is made within the given number of seconds,
x11spice will exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-allow-control\fR
This will enable a remote viewer to inject mouse or keyboard commands.

.SH EXIT STATUS
x11spice will return a status of 0 if it is able to start a Spice session.
It will return non zero in the event of an error.
.SH EXAMPLE

x11spice --generate-password
